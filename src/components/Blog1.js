        Its been awhile since I posted anything onto Instagram, Twitter, or linkedIn.  Right now, I am working on some personal projects, which I will talk about in the next couple of weeks, and I am working on polishing up this site. I hope to write more about my personal projects, and my thoughts on my work and other things related to software development.  I believe that it is best to contain my posts on this website instead instagram and twitter, because on this website I can provide images, context, explanations, etc. without character limitations.  I hope to look back on these posts one day and be proud of the progress that I have made over time.  I was inspired to write my own posts in this format after watching RWXROB's zettelkasten posts, and I am adding my own spin to this method of notetaking.  If you are interested in looking at my work, check-out my <a href="https://www.github.com/emmanuel-abreu/">Github here.</a>  Thanks for reading!
